                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our story
Chaos and frenzy signified every theatre production in the school after arranged seating. Sure, the paper ticket-selling system worked. Every year people get to see what they want, but why not live easier? The frustration that people face when they lose tickets and when seating couldnâ€™t be changed inspired us. We are a group of young programmers and designers who found each other in order to make a change. We aspire to replace the old paper system with a completely online system where ultimately, the exchange and reservation of a ticket can take place in the comfort of the home. Come and meet the team!</p>
